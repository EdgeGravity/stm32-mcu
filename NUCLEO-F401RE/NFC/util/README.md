## write_base_url.py 

Unfortunately, my home gateway does not support static IP address assignment on its embedded DHCP server.

This is an utility command to write base URL with a local IP address of wlan0 on RasPi to the dynamic NFC tag device.


```
  [ST25DV04K][STM32][FTDI] <--- base URL --- [/dev/tty][write_base_url.py]
```
