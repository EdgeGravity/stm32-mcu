# STMicroelectronics STM32 MCU evaluation

## Motivation

I have been using Microchip PIC MCUs for IoT prototyping over two years. But I have had chances to work with LoRa modules in the past year, and I realized that most of them use STM32 MCUs as a core. It seems to me that STM32 MCUs are becoming a standard platform for IoT devices supporting LPWA or BLE.

It is time to evaluate STM32, comparing with PIC MCUs.

## IDE

I use Eclipse-based [TrueSTUDIO](https://atollic.com/truestudio/) with [STM32 CubeMX Eclipse plugin](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32095.html) as IDE for this evaluation.

## Evaluation

I have got these STM32 boards.

### [STM32L476 Nucleo-64](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html)

=> [Eclipse projects](./STM32L476-Nucleo-64)

### [STM32F4 Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html)

=> [Eclipse projects](./STM32F4-Discovery)
