# Wireless transport for IoT and edge AI

I use wireless communication modules supporting operations on UART for prototyping IoT and edge AI.

## TWELITE

Although TWELITE is not so reliable, it is very cheap.

## Bluetooth Low Energy

I use Microchip RN4020 that supports Bluetooth 4.x.  They say Bluetooth 5 seems to be the way to go for edge AI.

## EnOcean

I used EnOcean just as a wireless switch to turn on LED.

## LoRa

I used LoRa for wireless communication in mountians.
